# Used Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop models that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on various features such as mileage, brand, model, and other relevant factors. This Jupyter Notebook project explores different models including simple linear regression, multiple regression, and random forest, aiming to achieve the highest possible accuracy in predicting car prices.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about used cars, including various features such as price, mileage, brand, model, and more.

## Future Work and Improvements
Although the project has achieved promising results, there is room for further improvement. Potential future directions include:
- Exploring additional models such as gradient boosting or neural networks.
- Incorporating more advanced feature engineering techniques to capture nonlinear relationships.
- Gathering more data or expanding the dataset to enhance model performance.
- Conducting hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model parameters.
- Implementing ensemble techniques or model stacking for improved predictive accuracy.
